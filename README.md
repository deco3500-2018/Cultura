## Areas of social and mobile theory
**Communication and social interactivity**

This application include this concept as we incorporate crowdsourcing platform where users around the world can add new experiences/definitions and vote definitions from other users. This way, we can connect people by allowing them to interact with each other’s cultures and countries using 'Add new experience' and 'Upvote/Downvote' functionality. The 'Upvote/Downvote' function is where we can measure the acceptability of a definition and the accuracy by allowing only locals to vote.

**Emotional Design**

For Culture Fever, we came out with engaging and interesting design of interface. All of the Norman’s three level design (Visceral emotional design, Behavioural emotional design and Reflective emotional design) must be fulfilled in order to create a positive experience to the users. The users will experience enjoyable interface along with feeling of safeness and security. Successful designs must incorporate users requirements as well as attend their emotional/aesthetic needs.

**Social Media**

Allow user to share the content of Culture Fever to their media social to widen the audience and increase website traffic. Users are able to interact with other users from outside the application easily with just a click of a button from their preferred medium like Facebook, Instagram and others.


# Summary
### Problem Space
**Cultural barriers** occurs when individuals from different cultures are unable to understand each other’s cultural norms, religious beliefs and daily practices resulting in communication breakdown and inconveniences. Fast cultural adjustments for someone outside one’s culture is crucial to promote better social inclusion in the community. Two important aspects of just about any given culture is its **code of etiquette** and its **use of body language**.

### Concept Statement
This project is to create a platform that allow people to look up a certain etiquette or gesture in one's country to learn more about it and behave appropriately in certain situation. We want to encourage people to be more respectful to different cultural customs and norms while being in a foreign country. What seems normal to one person might deem inappropriate to another person that have different cultural upbringing. For example, doing body languages or hand gestures that may regard as disrespectful to other cultures.  We have online dictionary for slang words and phrases like Urban Dictionary, this could work in a similar way because both slangs and body gestures, they do not have a standard definition. We want to allow people to be comfortable in a social situation with the aid of our application. 

**User scenario:**

An Australian business man went to China for business purposes, had to dine with fellow foreign delegates, he would want to learn how to behave in dining situation, what he should do or should not do to be respectful to others. For example, using chopsticks in a different way have different meanings, e.g. you don’t stick chopsticks straight up in a bowl of rice because it represents offering food to the dead people. 

How would you know this? Imagine if you do this in front of Chinese people. For that reason, we will learn more about people's travel behaviour and how this application will change their behaviour in the future.

### Design Solution
The ideal solution is a web application that allows its user to look up the use of body gesture and code of etiquette in all countries of the world. The core functionality of the website is the crowd-sourcing mechanism where user can engage by sharing their experience in social interaction happening in foreign countries e.g. the meaning of a gesture they wrongly used in the country. Whereas locals can upvote/downvote the post whether the gesture is widely used or acknowledged by the culture. This is inspired by the ‘wisdom of the crowd’ that many platform on the internet are using like Wikipedia and StackExchange. The web application will also presents substantial cultural differences in other countries for user to compare.
